# AI-support

This is an AI chatbot using Google Gemini for the text embedding and response. With Gemini text embedding and Pinecone vector database, RAG is implemented so it only responds based on the information from a certain PDF, YouTube video, or any other media. This is useful for AI customer support chatbots that need to be based on company/organization policies/information. Currently, the bot is based on analysis of Trump's Press Conference 2024.
